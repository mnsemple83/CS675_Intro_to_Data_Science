## Introduction
<p>The objective of this project was to apply some machine learning models to a dataset of choice. For this project, I chose a dataset of Airbnb listings in the New York City area, and used some classification models to predict their rating. While working on this project, I gained knowledge about feature engineering (e.g., converting data types of variables for use in the model), model building, and measuring model performance using different metrics.</p>

## Datasets
<p>The following is the sampled version of the original dataset (the original dataset can be found at this URL: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianazmoudeh/airbnbopendata">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianazmoudeh/airbnbopendata</a>)</p>
