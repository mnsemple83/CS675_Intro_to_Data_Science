## Introduction
<p>The objective of this project was to apply some machine learning models to a dataset of choice. For this project, I chose a dataset of Airbnb listings in the New York City area, and used some classification models to predict their rating. While working on this project, I gained knowledge about feature engineering (e.g., converting data types of variables for use in the model), model building, and measuring model performance using different metrics.</p>
