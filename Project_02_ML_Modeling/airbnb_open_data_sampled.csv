My apartment is kept very clean and tidy, so taking shoes off is essential to keeping it the same way for you and for me. Please stack the dishes in the dishwasher to the right of the sink. Some guests go out of their way to make sure they leave everything the way they found it and clean dishes by hand, but I actually prefer you use the dishwasher to washing by hand. This should be easier for you anyway! Dishwasher detergent is under the sink to the left of the trash.    When leaving the apartment, please always lock the top lock on the door.  Please shut off all the lights, AC unit, TV, etc. before you leave. If you open windows, please close and lock them before you leave the apartment.  ABSOLUTELY NO PARTIES!!! Sorry!",
