## Introduction
<p>The objective of this project was to use machine learning models to perform forecasting on a dataset. The dataset I had chosen for this project tracks the stock price of Microsoft. I used techniques such as time series decomposition to observe trends in the stock price and determine its seasonality, as well as observe relationships between current data and previous data. These techniques provided information regarding the future trend of the stock. The models used in this project would be modified in an attempt to improve their predictions.</p>
