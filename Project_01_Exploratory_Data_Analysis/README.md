## Introduction
<p>For this project, I learned how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on a selected dataset. The process involved some data cleaning and designing charts to represent the various relationships that exist among the data variables. The objective for this project was to learn about the importance of having high quality data (i.e., void of any missing values, duplicates, spelling errors, etc.), choosing the best charts to showcase variable relationships, and discovering which variables are most significant when trying to solve a given problem (e.g., what variables have the most influence on housing prices).</p>
